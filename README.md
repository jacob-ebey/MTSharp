MTSharp [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/0h6bt5q5lathg9kp/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jacob-ebey/mtsharp/branch/master)
=======

.Net library for comsuming MTConnect streams written in pure C#.

This library utilizes Linq and Xml.Linq to simplify and speed up the parsing of streams.

The structure was taken mostly from https://github.com/mtconnect/mtlinq but cleaned up and optimized
to have ~30% gain in performance.

MTSharp is avaliable on NuGet at [https://www.nuget.org/packages/MTSharp/](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MTSharp/).

MTConnect.Probe()
-----------------

MTConnect.Probe() gets all the devices but not the current result set. This is great if you need 
to get the Devices in a stream but do not need the data at the time. MTConnect.Probe will make a 
request every time it is called, so if you want the devices from the last time, use MTConnect.Devices().
If MTConnect.Probe has has not been called, MTConnect.Devices will make the call for you.


MTConnect.Current()
-------------------

MTConnect.Current() is used to get all Devices in a stream along with an enumerable dataset of Result's.

Examples
-------

### Get all devices in a stream

Notice below how the example url does not contain a "/current" at the end, DO NOT add the "/current".

```C#
MTConnect connect = new MTConnect("http://url-to-stream");
IEnumerable<Device> devices = connect.Probe().Select(entry => entry.Value);
```


### Get the results for a device in a stream

This example get all results for a device named "TestDevice" within the stream.

```C#
MTConnect connect = new MTConnect("http://url-to-stream");
IEnumerable<Result> results = connect.Current()["TestDevice"];
```
